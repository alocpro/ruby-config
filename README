== Author

Modified from Original Project (AppConfig by Christopher J. Bottaro)

=== Compatibility
Rails 3.0

=== Installing on Rails 3

add this to your Gemfile

    gem "rails_config"

=== Accessing the Settings object
After installing this plugin, the Settings object will be global available.  Entries are accessed via object member notation:
 Settings.my_config_entry
Nested entries are supported:
 Settings.my_section.some_entry

=== Common config file
Config entries are compiled from
 config/settings.yml
 config/settings/#{environment}.yml
 config/environments/#{environment}.yml

settings defined in files that are lower in the list override settings higher

=== Reloading config files
You can reload the Settings from file at any time by running Settings.reload!

=== Environment specific config files
You can have environment specific config files.  Environment specific config entries take precedence over common config entries.

Example development environment config file:
 #{Rails.root}/config/environments/development.yml

Example production environment config file:
 #{Rails.root}/config/environments/production.yml

=== Embedded Ruby (ERB)
 Embedded Ruby is allowed in the configuration files.  See examples below.

=== Accessing Configuration Settings
Consider the two following config files.

#{Rails.root}/config/settings.yml:
 size: 1
 server: google.com

#{Rails.root}/config/environments/development.yml:
 size: 2
 computed: <%= 1 + 2 + 3 %>
 section:
   size: 3
   servers: [ {name: yahoo.com}, {name: amazon.com} ]

Notice that the environment specific config entries overwrite the common entries.
 Settings.size -> 2
 Settings.server -> google.com

Notice the embedded Ruby.
 Settings.computed -> 6

Notice that object member notation is maintained even in nested entries.
 Settings.section.size -> 3

Notice array notation and object member notation is maintained.
 Settings.section.servers[0].name -> yahoo.com
 Settings.section.servers[1].name -> amazon.com
